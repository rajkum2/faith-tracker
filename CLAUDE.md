# PropYaar Frontend

## What is PropYaar?

PropYaar is an **Indian real estate platform** with interactive maps, property listings, GIS drawing tools, and AI-powered property search. It serves home buyers, sellers, and investors with features like map visualization with layouts, 3D tours, fractional investment, and multi-language support.

**Currency**: INR (Crores/Lakhs).

> **Note**: This codebase also contains Meeru AI enterprise finance modules under the `(main)` route group. PropYaar is the primary product, served from the `(site)` route group.

## Tech Stack

Next.js 13 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, Lucide icons, Leaflet + React Leaflet + Leaflet Geoman (maps + drawing). Current page count: 105 (`find app -name page.tsx | wc -l`). No testing framework.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run build        # Production build (use to verify zero TS errors)
npm run lint         # ESLint (ignored during builds)
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run format       # Prettier write
npm run format:check # Prettier check
```

Always run `npm run build` after significant changes to verify zero TypeScript errors.

## Environment

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_SOURCE=json   # "json" (default) or "api" — switches data provider at runtime
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api  # Only needed when DATA_SOURCE=api
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000  # Used by Next.js server routes (SSE/query/sessions proxies)
```

## Path Aliases

Prefer `@/` imports for cross-folder/shared modules. Relative imports are acceptable for local same-feature files.
```ts
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { useIgrsCases } from "@/hooks/data"
```

## The 7 Rails — Functional Overview

### Rail 1: HOME (Personal Workspace & AI)
Personal command center and collaboration hub.

| Page | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Command Center** | AI chat interface — query financial data in natural language, generate visualizations, execute bulk actions |
| **My Workspace** | Customizable dashboard with live KPIs, recent items, quick actions |
| **Live Pins** | Monitor critical metrics with auto-refresh, alert thresholds, sparkline trends |
| **Watchlist** | Track high-value entities (customers, cases, invoices) with condition-based alerts |

### Rail 4: WORKBENCH (Operational Execution)
Action-oriented tools for deep operational work. Unlike Reports, Workbenches are fully editable.

#### Order-to-Cash (O2C) — Cash Management & Collections
**Core flow**: Bank files imported → AI matching engine suggests payment-to-invoice matches → analyst reviews by confidence score → post to GL.

| Page | What It Does |
|------|-------------|

**Key metrics**: Auto-match rate (>85%), processing time (<2hr), unapplied cash aging, DSO (<45 days)

#### Procure-to-Pay (P2P)
| Page | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **SaaS Renewal** | Contract lifecycle management — renewals, volume discounts, usage vs. licensed seats. Uses Chart.js |
| **AP Exceptions** | 3-way match exceptions (invoice vs PO vs receipt) — quantity/price mismatches, duplicates |

#### Record-to-Report (R2R) — Period-End Close
**Close phases**: Pre-Close (Day 1-10) → Core Close (Day 10-11) → Post-Close (Day 12-14) → Reporting (Day 15+)

| Page | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Close Workbench** | Orchestrates 30-100 month-end tasks — dependencies, critical path, SLA alerts, blocker escalation. Target: <5 days to close |
| **Reconciliations** | GL-to-subledger reconciliation — auto-match, investigate unmatched, certify, attach evidence |

**SOX stage workflow**: DRAFT → PREPARED → IN_REVIEW → APPROVED → POSTED_LOCKED (immutable)

#### Other Workbench Modules
| Page | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **MRP** (Supply Chain) | Material Requirements Planning — PO status tracking, supplier performance, delivery delays |
| **BPO Setup** | Configure Business Process Outsourcing vendors — SLA targets, staff, accuracy, contract management |
| **Variance Drivers** (FP&A) | Root cause analysis of budget variances — volume, price, mix, timing, FX, one-time items |

8. **Stamp Inventory** (`StampInventory`) — Physical stamp paper inventory discrepancy
9. **Classification Fraud** (`ClassificationFraud`) — Wrong property classification (Webland/Form cross-verification) to reduce stamp duty

| Page | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Overview** | Executive dashboard — total payable/paid/gap, high-risk cases, daily cash risk score, top offices by gap |
| **Cases** | Case management (New → In Review → Confirmed → Resolved/Rejected) with risk levels, confidence scores |

```

## Coding Conventions

- All pages use `"use client"` directive
- `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class names
- Use `Array.from()` instead of Set spreading (not supported in tsconfig)
- Use `formatInr()` for INR currency (Cr for 10M+, L for 100K+, K for 1K+)
- Use `$` + `toLocaleString()` for USD amounts
- Badge variants: `"destructive"` for high/critical, `"secondary"` for medium, `"outline"` for low
- Badge color pattern: `className="bg-{color}-50 text-{color}-700 border-{color}-200"`
- Prefer inline SVG charts unless page already uses recharts/Chart.js
- AG Grid for Reports rail and data-template pages
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

## Page Pattern

```
"use client"
imports → interface → MOCK_DATA → badge helpers → default export function
  → useState (search, filters, selected record)
  → useMemo (filtered data, KPI calculations)
  → return:
    <div className="flex flex-col bg-white" style={{ height: '100%', minHeight: 0 }}>
      <header> sticky breadcrumb + icon + title + description + border </header>
      <div className="flex-1 overflow-auto">
        <div className="w-full max-w-[1363px] mx-auto px-6 py-6">
          4x KPI cards (grid-cols-4, card-interactive class)
          Filter bar (search Input + Select dropdowns)
          Table with clickable rows → opens Sheet/Dialog drawer
        </div>
      </div>
      <Sheet> detail drawer: summary grid + action buttons </Sheet>
    </div>
```

## Tailwind Custom Tokens

Defined in `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`:
- **Gradients**: `gradient-primary` (blue), `gradient-accent` (indigo), `gradient-success/warning/danger`
- **Elevation shadows**: `elevation-1` through `elevation-4`
- **Animations**: `card-lift`, `fade-in-up`, `slide-in-right`, `scale-in`, `glow-pulse`
- **Colors**: HSL CSS variables for theming (light + dark mode via `.dark` class)

## API Routes (Internal Mock)

Key routes in `app/api/`:
- `/api/close/tasks` — Close management tasks
- `/api/mrp-workbench` — MRP workbench CRUD
- `/api/data-templates` — Template management
- `/api/sessions/[userId]` — Chat sessions
- `/api/dynamic-sheets` — Spreadsheet CRUD
- `/api/recons` — Reconciliation
- `/api/sse` — Server-Sent Events (streaming)
- `/api/commandQuery` — Query submission proxy
- `/api/query/[queryId]/result` — Query result proxy/polling

## Important Notes

- Revenue Leakage is **IGRS-only**, NOT part of Meeru AI scope
- Old `revenue-assurance/` route is a duplicate of IGRS (11 pages, hook-based)
- Chart libraries vary: recharts, Chart.js, inline SVG — match the existing page's approach
- No testing framework — verify with `npm run build` and manual navigation
- Deployment: standalone output for Docker, Netlify-aware conditional config

## Documentation Maintenance Policy (Mandatory)

- `CLAUDE.md` must be updated whenever project behavior, structure, routes, APIs, conventions, tooling, environment variables, or architecture changes.
- This applies to **all** code changes, including changes made by Codex.
- Update this file in the same change set as the code change (same PR/commit batch), not later.
- Do **not** rewrite the whole document for routine updates. Use append-only updates in the `## Update Log (Append-Only)` section.
- Keep existing sections intact unless information is incorrect; in that case, correct the inaccurate line and add an append-only log entry explaining what changed.
- Each append-only update entry must include:
  - Date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - What changed
  - Affected paths/routes/modules
  - Any required env/script/command changes
  - Backward-compatibility or migration notes (if any)

## Update Log (Append-Only)

### 2026-02-24
- Corrected stale/inaccurate metadata:
  - Page count updated to 91 with command reference.
  - Added `API_BASE_URL` to environment variables for Next.js server proxy routes.
  - Clarified import guidance (`@/` preferred; local relative imports allowed).
  - Corrected root layout/provider order to match implementation.
  - Updated API routes list to include `/api/commandQuery` and `/api/query/[queryId]/result`.

- **Collections Workbench — UI Overhaul + Disputes Tab**: Reworked layout to match Cash Application Workbench pattern and added Disputes as 5th tab.
  - **Layout overhaul**: Removed sticky header/breadcrumb/title, sidebar, large KPI cards. Adopted Cash App flat `bg-slate-50` layout with inline Popover filters, compact stat chips (`text-[11px]`), and native `<table>` elements.
  - **Fixed Dunning crash**: Moved `dunningStatusCounts` useMemo from inside conditionally-called `renderSidebar()` to component top level (React Rules of Hooks violation).
  - **Disputes tab** (5th tab): 10 mock dispute records with types/constants/badge maps. 4 compact KPI stats (Total/Open/Disputed Amount/Avg Aging). Filter popover with status/priority/reason selects. 10-column table (ID, Customer, Invoice, Disputed, Original, Reason, Status, Priority, Aging, Assignee).

### 2026-02-27 (g)
- **Cash Application Workbench — Match Collections UI/UX**: Updated toolbar layout to match Collections Workbench clean style.
  - **Replaced SegmentedControl** with simple tab buttons (`px-3 py-1.5 text-xs rounded-md` with active state `bg-white text-primary shadow-sm border`). 6 tabs: All, Auto-Matched, Exceptions, Critical, Pending to Post, Settlement. Click active tab to deselect.
  - **Added compact KPI stat chips** on right side of tab row: Total (count), Auto-Match (% green), Exceptions (red if >0), Pending (combined pendingToPost + settlementPending).
  - **Removed DensityToggle** from toolbar (import removed, component removed from JSX; density state kept in hook — no breaking change).
  - **Restructured toolbar**: Row 1 = tab buttons + KPI stats; Row 2 = Search input + Filters Popover. Previously everything was in a single row.
  - **Removed imports**: `SegmentedControl`, `DensityToggle`. **Added import**: `cn` from `@/lib/utils`.
  - **File modified**: `app/(main)/workbench/order-to-cash/cash-application/payments/page.tsx`.
  - No env/script/command changes. No breaking API changes. Build verified with zero TypeScript errors.

### 2026-02-27 (h)
- **Cash App Workbench — Clean Layout Matching Collections**: Removed visual clutter from Cash Application layout and payments page.
  - **Layout (`layout.tsx`)**: Removed title header (`<header>` with "Cash Application Workbench" title, Sync badge tooltip). Removed `border-b` from nav tabs section. Changed nav background from `bg-white` to `bg-slate-50` to blend with content area. Updated nav tab active state from `bg-slate-100 text-slate-900` to `bg-white text-primary shadow-sm border` (matching Collections pattern). Removed unused imports: `Tooltip`, `TooltipContent`, `TooltipProvider`, `TooltipTrigger`, `Badge`. Removed unused `dataHealth` variable.
  - **Payments page (`payments/page.tsx`)**: Merged two rows (status tabs + KPI stats, Search + Filters) into a single row. Dropped Settlement tab (5→4 status segments: All, Auto-Matched, Exceptions, Critical, Pending to Post). Updated KPI stat chips to use Collections-style pill containers (`bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-md`). Updated Filters button to use `text-primary`/`bg-primary` color scheme instead of hardcoded blue.
  - **Sub-filter toggle fix (`usePaymentsQueue.ts`)**: `handleSubFilterClick` now toggles — clicking the active chip clears it (sets to `""`) instead of re-setting same value.
  - No env/script/command changes. No breaking API changes. Build verified with zero TypeScript errors.

### 2026-03-02
- **One-Click Variance — Data/Type Fix**: Fixed critical type mismatch between `FluxVariance` interface and actual JSON data.
  - **Root cause**: `FluxVariance` type defined `currentPeriod`/`priorPeriod` as `number` but JSON has them as strings (`"Q4 2024"`). Actual dollar amounts are in `currentValue`/`priorValue` fields (not in the type). Similarly `variancePct` → `variancePercent`, `materialityFlag` → `isSignificant`.
  - **Type fix** (`lib/data/types/reports.ts`): Updated `FluxVariance` to match JSON: `currentPeriod`/`priorPeriod` as `string`, added `currentValue`/`priorValue` as `number`, `variancePercent`, `threshold`, `isSignificant`, `reviewedBy`/`reviewedAt`/`comments`. Added backward-compat optional `variancePct`/`materialityFlag`.
  - **Transform fix** (`one-click-variance/page.tsx`): `transformFluxToGrouped` now reads `v.currentValue`/`v.priorValue` instead of `v.currentPeriod`/`v.priorPeriod`.
  - **Display fixes**: Added `fmtCompact()` for large numbers (B/M/K). KPI cards use compact format. Table Current/Prior/$ Var columns use compact format. Top/Bottom mover badges show `effectiveGroups.length` instead of `analysis?.groups.length || 0`. Group column shows "account" when displaying flux data.
  - No env/script/command changes. No breaking API changes. TypeScript typecheck passes with zero errors.

### 2026-03-02 (b)
- **One-Click Variance — UI/UX Overhaul to Match Cash App Style**: Redesigned page from sidebar+Card+header layout to flat Cash App workbench pattern.
  - **Layout**: Replaced `bg-white` with `bg-slate-50`. Removed title header (`<header>` with breadcrumb, h1, description, border). Removed sidebar `<aside>` with Card controls. Now full-width flat layout like Cash App.
  - **Toolbar row**: Mode tabs (MoM/QoQ/YoY) as simple rounded buttons with `text-primary` active state. Inline period selects (month + year). Search input. Filters Popover (Entity, Customer, Group by). Run button. Download button. KPI stat chips on right (`bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-md` matching Collections/Cash App).
  - **Data on load**: Changed `hasRun` default from `false` to `true` so synthetic analysis data shows immediately without clicking "Run Analysis". Added search filtering on account names.
  - **Tables**: Replaced Shadcn `Table`/`Card` components with native `<table>` inside `bg-white rounded-lg border` containers (matching Cash App pattern). Removed "Group" column. Added "All Variances" table replacing the old "Details" section — shows all accounts sorted by absolute variance, with color-coded badges and directional icons. Top/Bottom tables show empty state message when no data matches.
  - **Removed imports**: `Button`, `Label`, `Card`, `Badge`, `RadioGroup`, `RadioGroupItem`, `Table`/`TableBody`/`TableCell`/`TableHead`/`TableHeader`/`TableRow`, `Breadcrumb`, `useEffect`. Added: `Popover`/`PopoverContent`/`PopoverTrigger`, `Play`, `Search`, `ListFilter`.
  - No env/script/command changes. No breaking API changes. TypeScript typecheck passes with zero errors.

### 2026-03-02 (c)
- **One-Click Variance — Demo-Ready Enhancements**: Added dynamic features and controls for demo purposes.
  - **Data source toggle**: Switch between "Account Data" (flux API data from `useFluxAnalysis`) and "Synthetic" (randomly generated transactions). Toggle buttons in toolbar.
  - **Significance filter tabs**: "All" / "Material" / "Below Threshold" filters based on `isSignificant` field. Active tab styled with `bg-white text-primary shadow-sm border`.
  - **SVG Waterfall chart**: Top 8 accounts by absolute variance rendered as inline SVG bar chart with green (positive) and red (negative) bars, value labels, rotated account names.
  - **StatusBadge component**: Color-coded badges for Reviewed (green), InReview (amber), AutoClosed (slate) statuses.
  - **VarianceBar component**: Inline horizontal bar showing variance magnitude relative to max, colored green/red by direction.
  - **Clickable rows → Sheet drawer**: Click any row to open detail drawer showing: account info grid, AI explanation section (Sparkles icon, italic text), variance bar visualization, status/reviewer/threshold info, action buttons (Mark Reviewed, Flag for Review, Add Comment).
  - **Enhanced KPI chips**: Added Material count and Reviewed count chips alongside existing Total/Top/Bottom movers.
  - **Toast notifications**: Mark Reviewed and Flag actions trigger sonner toasts.
  - Added imports: `Sheet`/`SheetContent`/`SheetHeader`/`SheetTitle`, `AlertTriangle`, `CheckCircle2`, `Clock`, `Sparkles`, `X`, `Eye`, `FileText`, `toast` from sonner.
  - No env/script/command changes. No breaking API changes. Build compiles successfully (pre-existing `styled-jsx` copy error unrelated).

### 2026-03-02 (d)
- **Flux Analysis — UI/UX Overhaul to Match Cash App Workbench Pattern**: Redesigned the Flux Analysis page (`app/(main)/reports/analysis/flux-analysis/page.tsx`) for visual consistency.
  - **Removed header**: Removed sticky `<header>` block with Breadcrumb, icon, title ("Flux Analysis"), description, period/consolidation/currency badges, Export and Create Watch buttons.
  - **Compact toolbar**: Single toolbar row with: view tab buttons (Income Statement / Balance Sheet / Cash Flow Bridge) as `bg-white text-primary shadow-sm` active state, inline Period/Consolidation/Currency selects, Filters Popover (Materiality, Owner, Status, Exclude Noise), Export button, +Watch button. Compact KPI stat chips on right (Revenue, Gross Margin, Op CF, WC Delta) matching Cash App/One-Click Variance pattern.
  - **Filters Popover**: Moved Materiality, Owner, Status selects and Exclude Noise checkbox into a `Popover` component with active filter count badge.
  - **Native tables**: Replaced all Shadcn `Table`/`TableHeader`/`TableRow`/`TableHead`/`TableBody`/`TableCell` with native `<table>`/`<thead>`/`<tr>`/`<th>`/`<tbody>`/`<td>` elements. Applied consistent `px-3 py-2 text-[11px]` header styling and `border-b border-slate-100` row separators.
  - **Removed Card wrappers**: Replaced `<Card>` components with plain `<div className="bg-white rounded-lg border border-slate-200">` containers for tab tables, top drivers, AI sidebar sections (AI Analysis, AI Proposed Explanations, Sensitivity Analysis).
  - **Removed Tabs component**: Replaced Shadcn `Tabs`/`TabsList`/`TabsTrigger`/`TabsContent` with plain buttons + conditional rendering using existing `activeView` state.
  - **Removed imports**: `Card`, `Table`/`TableBody`/`TableCell`/`TableHead`/`TableHeader`/`TableRow`, `Tabs`/`TabsContent`/`TabsList`/`TabsTrigger`, `Breadcrumb`, `BarChart3`.
  - **Added imports**: `Popover`/`PopoverContent`/`PopoverTrigger`, `ListFilter`.
  - AI sidebar, detail drawer, evidence dialog, watch dialog, sensitivity sliders, and all business logic unchanged.
  - **Mock data fix**: Updated 5 records in `public/data/reports/flux-analysis.json` to have negative variances (Accounts Receivable -$32M, Accounts Payable -$26M, Deferred Revenue -$24M, Cost of Product Revenue -$20M, R&D -$17M) so the One-Click Variance "Top Decreases" table shows data.
  - No env/script/command changes. No breaking API changes. Build compiles successfully.

### 2026-03-02 (e)
- **Titles + One-Click Variance Cleanup**: Added compact title to Cash Application layout and removed synthetic data mode from One-Click Variance page.
  - **Cash Application title** (`layout.tsx`): Added `<div className="px-5 pt-3 pb-1 bg-slate-50">` with `text-sm font-semibold` heading "Cash Application" and `text-[11px] text-slate-500` subtitle above the navigation tabs.
  - **One-Click Variance cleanup** (`one-click-variance/page.tsx`): Removed synthetic data source entirely — deleted `Transaction` interface, `generateSyntheticData()` function, `rnd()`/`pick()` helpers, `ENTITIES`/`CUSTOMERS`/`MONTH_NAMES` constants, `facts`/`dataSource`/`mode`/`month`/`year`/`entity`/`customerFilter`/`groupBy`/`hasRun` state variables, `years` useMemo, `getPriorPeriod()` function, `analysis` useMemo, `handleRun()` function, data source toggle buttons, MoM/QoQ/YoY mode tabs, month/year selects, Run button, Filters popover (entity/customer/groupBy). Simplified `effectiveGroups` to always use `fluxGrouped`. Removed all `dataSource === 'flux'` conditionals (Status column and AI sparkle icon now always shown). Removed unused imports: `Select`/`SelectContent`/`SelectItem`/`SelectTrigger`/`SelectValue`, `Popover`/`PopoverContent`/`PopoverTrigger`, `ListFilter`, `Play`. Toolbar now has: Search + Download.
  - No env/script/command changes. No breaking API changes. Build compiles successfully.

### 2026-03-08 (e)
- **PropYaar Layout Restructure — Standalone Site Layout**: Replaced Meeru AppShell with PropYaar's own header/footer layout. Moved all PropYaar pages from `(main)/propyaar/` to `(site)/` route group.
  - **New route group** `app/(site)/layout.tsx`: Wraps all PropYaar pages with `PropYaarI18nProvider` + `SiteHeader` + `SiteFooter`. No Meeru AppShell, no sidebar, no nav panel.
  - **New component** `components/propyaar/site-footer.tsx`: 4-column footer matching old React Footer.js — brand/description, menu links (Buy/Rent/Projects/Blog), information (About/Contact/Agents/Agent FB Group), legal (Privacy/Refund/Terms/Cookie). Bottom bar with copyright (Risee Proptech) and social icons (Facebook/Instagram/YouTube/Twitter). Dark slate-900 background.
  - **New home page** `app/(site)/page.tsx`: Hero banner with background image (`/assets/img/banner/3.jpg`), city selector dropdown, search bar. 3 CTA cards (Buying/Selling/Investing) overlapping banner. New Listings grid (4 columns, from `usePropertyListings` hook). "Why PropYaar" section. Contact CTA section.
  - **Route migration**: All pages moved from `app/(main)/propyaar/*` to `app/(site)/*`. Routes changed from `/propyaar/properties` → `/properties`, `/propyaar/blog` → `/blog`, etc. All internal route references updated to remove `/propyaar/` prefix.
  - **Deleted**: `app/(main)/propyaar/` directory (all pages now under `(site)`).
  - **Root page**: `app/page.tsx` deleted — `(site)/page.tsx` now serves `/` as PropYaar home page.
  - **Root layout metadata**: Changed from "Meeru AI Chat" to "PropYaar - Real Estate Properties".
  - **CLAUDE.md**: Updated title, description, and project structure to reflect PropYaar as primary product.
  - Page count: 105 (unchanged — moved pages, added 1 home page, removed root redirect). No env/script/command changes. TypeScript: zero errors.
